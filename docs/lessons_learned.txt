Terraform/Terragrunt
-----------------------
Newer versions have removed provider version constraints (gotcha)
If you are using a bucket for TF state, make sure it exists
 - planning results in no console output and hangs forever with no feedback
 - cd'ing into the target env directory then performing an init revealed the issue
 - init was prompting for (y|n) to create the missing bucket, TG had no way of passing that to the console (bug?)
Network/Subnetwork not created beforehand causes a race condition when applying an env
 - consider using TF module to set up the networking layer in advance
 - re-provisioning your env results in success
Cluster provisioning takes ~5 minutes (be patient...)
MySQL provisioning takes 15+ minutes....WOW!!! What is GCP doing, writing the entire structured query language from scratch???
Destroying resrouces in an env takes a long time as well
 - GCP does not seem as fast as other cloud providers, their resources take a lot longer to provision (maybe because free tier?)
A lot of APIs need to be enabled before you can interact with resources... just takes a lot of getting used to the nuances!
GCP SQL would be nice to know this beforehand...
 - When you delete an instance, you cannot reuse the name of the deleted instance until one week from the deletion date

Kubernetes resources
-----------------------
Getting kubeconfig is overly complex for no good reason, why do I need their gcloud command to get kubeconfig? C'mon Google!
Cluster takes a long time to be in ready state when provisioning from IaC




------
Why?
------
Kubernetes cluster on GCP GKE
 - provides great scalability
 - application front-end can be scaled based on demand 

MySQL on GCP SQL
 - better to host databases outside the cluster
 - better scalability
 - read replicas can be used for increased security (use for web front-end type data that does not need write access)

Scaling a public-facing application with Kubernetes on GKE
 - node pool: scale nodes as needed
 - scale replicas
 - Implement DaemonSets

Monitoring on Kubernetes
 - ServiceMonitors
 - Prometheus is your friend
 - Grafan dashboards and alerts (Slack)
